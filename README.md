## 🚀 What is KYTE?

KYTE is a decentralized platform that automates the relationship between developers and clients. By combining **Algorand Smart Contracts** with **AI-powered code auditing**, we ensure that payments are only released when the code meets the predefined requirements.

### The Problem
Traditional freelancing depends on trust or expensive escrow services. Disputes over "code quality" often lead to payment delays or unfair chargebacks.

### The Solution
1. **Client** locks ALGO into a smart contract with specific requirements.
2. **Developer** submits their work via GitHub.
3. **Gemini AI** audits the submission against the requirements.
4. If it passes, the **Smart Contract** automatically releases funds. No human intervention needed.

npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` in the root:
